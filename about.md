# About Dime Box Pecans

Nestled in the heart of Texas in a small community with an outsized grasp
on the hearts and minds of all Texans, Dime Box Pecans is an 85 acre ranch in
between College Station and Austin. Most recently used for cattle and hay, we
have adopted it and are in the process of transforming it into a pecan orchard.

As hobbies go, it would have been cheaper to just buy a boat.
